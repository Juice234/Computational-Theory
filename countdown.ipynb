    "The Numbers Game is a segment from the television show Countdown, the objective of the games is to reach a randomly generated number between 101 and 999 using a combination of **six** chosen numbers. These six numbers are chosen by the contestants, they do not get to choose the exact number but rather get to choose from \"BIG\" numbers (25,50,75,100) and \"SMALL\" numbers (1-10), they are not limited by the combination of big and small numbers meaning they can choose only big numbers or only small numbers\n",

The contestants are then given 30 seconds to solve for the target number using the previously chosen six numbers, they can perform basic arithmetic operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with one rule being that all numbers resulting from these operations must be whole numbers, the contestants can only use each number once weather it's from the six initial numbers or the ones resulting from the arithmetic operations. \n",

    "## Computational Complexity of The Game \n",
    "The computational complexity of The Numbers Game from Countdown involves examining all operations and combinations that can be created from six chosen numbers to reach a target number. The complexity arises from several factors: \n",
    " \n",
    "### Combination of Numbers \n",
    "The initial choice of six numbers from a pool of \"BIG\" and \"SMALL\" creates the starting array of numbers available. This choice marks the beginning of the computational complexity in solving the target number. Why is this complex? Assuming the six numbers, there are 720 ways to order these numbers, and given five slots between each, there are 1024 ways to assign an operation to each slot between the numbers. This gives us 737,280 combinations of just six numbers and operations; this count does not even include the use of parentheses; for instance, '(a+b)\\*c' is different from 'a+(b\\*c).' Thus, the actual number of combinations is significantly more. However, determining the exact number is challenging because one of the game's rules is that each operation must result in a whole number. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Permutations of Operations \n",
    "The choice and sequence of operations add a layer of complexity. Each number can be combined with another using any of the four operations, remembering that the resulting operation must be a whole number. Once the two numbers are combined, they can be used with the remaining numbers, increasing the total possibilities exponentially as the choice of which numbers are taken. The choice of which operations are made plays a significant role in the lead to the solution where computationally, some operations may not be viable to reach the solution but will be tested by an algorithm anyway. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Logic/Human Factor \n",
    "Another layer of computational complexity is the human logic factor. People do not think like brute-force algorithms attempting to force a solution. Instead, they employ strategies to solve problems, such as identifying patterns among the numbers to find a clear solution. For example, if the six numbers are 2, 100, 75, 3, and 5, and the target is 200, the most logical solution is 2\\*100, which results in 200. Humans also eliminate numbers that will not lead to the answer; using the previous example, there is no point in exploring combinations involving 3, 5, and 2, as they will not come close to the target. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Impossible Solutions \n",
    "Another aspect to consider is impossible solutions or combinations of numbers that will not work. This includes dividing numbers that would result in a fraction or number combinations that produce the same result, e.g., 2 \\* 3 and 3 \\* 2 are the same but consume processing time. Along with this logic must be placed to find combinations which are close the to target number as the inital 6 numbers may not always lead to a solution.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Pruning techniques \n",
    "So, if brute-forcing the problem is not viable, what are ways we can improve the process? We can incorporate alpha-beta pruning, which involves eliminating branches that cannot lead to the final solution. For example, if we go over the target number and have explored further division operations, there is no point in trying to solve the problem. The same can be applied if the resulting operation is a fraction, as further operations will simply not lead to the solution. This can be used in conjunction with backtracking, which explores possible solutions and abandons paths that will not lead to a solution by going back a step to try a different path(operation) \n",

    "## Recurssive aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference in logic is introduced with code which reuses previous operation results to form new operations:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "   - The `solve_numbers` function divides the problem into smaller subproblems by selecting two numbers and applying one of the four arithmetic operations to generate a new result. \n",
    "   - This process is repeated recursively for each combination of numbers and operations until a base case is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case:** \n",
    "   - The base case occurs when there is only one number left in the list of numbers. \n",
    "   - At this point, the function checks if the remaining number matches the target number. \n",
    "   - If it does, it returns a solution. Otherwise, it backtracks and explores other possible combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Calls:** \n",
    "   - Inside the `solve_numbers` function, recursive calls are made to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations. \n",
    "   - Each recursive call works on a smaller instance of the original problem by updating the list of numbers with the result of an arithmetic operation and continuing the exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining Solutions:** \n",
    "   - As the recursion unwinds and returns from deeper levels, solutions from smaller subproblems are combined to solve larger subproblems. \n",
    "   - The function keeps track of the best solution found so far (`best_diff` and `best_solution`) and updates them whenever a closer solution is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Early Exit Optimization:** \n",
    "   - If the exact target number is found during the recursion, the function immediately returns the solution without further exploration. \n",
