## Countdown Numbers Game Solver
### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook solver for the "Countdown Numbers Game," a popular segment from the television show Countdown. The solver utilizes a combination of arithmetic and recursive algorithms to find solutions or the closest possible solution to the game's challenge.

### How It Works
The Countdown Numbers Game involves choosing six numbers from a predefined set and using basic arithmetic operations to achieve a randomly generated target number. The solver in this repository generates all possible operations from the selected numbers and uses recursive search techniques to find the path to the target number or the closest solution.

###Features
Generate Operations: Functionality to create all valid arithmetic operations from the chosen numbers.
Recursive Solver: A recursive algorithm to explore potential solutions to reach the target number.
Efficiency Optimizations: Implements early exit and memoization to enhance performance.
